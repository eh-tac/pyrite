This is going to be a very lengthy definition of the XvT mission file. Due
to the size of the files we'll be dealing with, I'll be using the extended
structure write-up first seen in the TIE95 Mission File definition. If you see
portions of this write-up that look similar to the TIE95 write-up, that's
because they're probably word-for-word.

The file itself is made of up multiple sections, equatable to a single resource
in a LFD with multiple subheaders. For the purpose of these file descriptions,
each section will will begin at '0', such that to find an offset in a later
section, you simply add the total length of the sections before it to get
there. This is what I use in my personal notes, so this is what I am forcing
upon you. I win. I'll try to keep the mission design comments to a minimum,
but I promise nothing.

=====
XvT Mission Overview

The mission files are found in the \TRAIN directory, have the .TIE file
extension and no required naming convention, just that the appropriate .LST
has the filename spelled correctly to be able to play it. The LEC naming
convention for the files is a little more involved than in TIE95 and varies
depending on the type of mission you're creating. Since the naming convention
doesn't have any effect on playing the mission, I'm going to skip over this.

There are already a couple editors out there for XvT missions, most notably
XvTEd. Anyone with a lot of spare time and a hex editor can map out these
values, and whadya know, I was bored :P

=====
XvT Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character
SHORT	2	signed Int16
INT	4	signed Int32
STR(*)	*	null-terminated string, * is an integer

NOTE: Any byte locations that are between defined values and are not explicitly
defined are deemed as Reserved(0), and have only been found to have zero
values. Unknown bytes that have non-zero values have been called out in the
structure. Rest assured you have everything here to piece together a mission
file from scratch, but please note offsets if creating read/write procedures.

NOTE2: Since XvT is a step up from TIE95, the mission file is larger and more
complex.  There are many sections that are repeated, and several additional
sections that are introduced, some of which being dynamic in size.  You'll see
the appropriate notes as needed.

XvT Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway.
Supplementary definitions and lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

Much like TIE95, the first 6 bytes are well-defined. The PlatformID byte can be
one of two values.
12	XvT
14	BoP
The only known difference between platforms is seen at the very end, and a few
more Unknown values

The MissionType value defines the mission as either a Training (normal) mission
or a combat mission.
00	Training
01	Unknown
02	Melee
03	Multiplayer Training
04	Multiplayer Combat

Following that are the TimeLimit values, and a seemingly bunch of blank space.

-- FlightGroup --

The first string is obvious. The Pilot string from TIE95 has been removed, and
instead there's a new section for craft roles. This is where the specialized
messages are controlled. The full listing will be below. Roles can only be
set for Imperials, Rebels, Team 3 and Team 4. It is also possible to set a
role for all teams. The Designation stored is only the first three letters of
the full item. The Team is a CHAR and can have these values:
31	'1'		Imperial
32	'2'		Rebel
33	'3'		Team 3
34	'4'		Team 4
61	'a'		All
68	'h'		Unknown
It is unknown if the remaining teams can have roles, but they have been seen
in LEC-produced missions. An alternate usage seen in LEC missions is defining
an AI level across both the Team and Designation fields, instead using this
area as a different string value. The effect of this is unknown, as the strings
seen don't match the craft's, but it's possible that it may instead give the
Designation to a team, it may give it to a certain AI level.

Now we're back to traditional values, with both Cargo strings, and a bunch of
familiar values you've seen in TIE95. The only item inserted here is Team,
which should be easy enough to figure out. Radio operates differently
in XvT. Instead of a binary switch, the value can be set to any team or
player, 1-8. The full listing is defined later.

Formation is obvious, but I'll explain the next couple. FormationSpacing is
the spacing between the craft. GlobalGroup is a great way grouping (gasp)
craft primarily for order and trigger use. Instead of listing out each FG
or craft type in a order you can lump everything to a GG and use a single
target. LeaderSpacing is how far ahead of the rest of the flight group the
flight leader is. Having a flight leader way out front can absorb fire and let
the rest of the group fire salvos before being attacked themselves.  

NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, but the number you'll likely see in editors is
the number of total waves. A few values have been inserted here, the first
being PlayerNumber. One-indexed, with zero meaning AI-controlled. Next is
ArriveOnlyIfHuman, which is a boolean value that as its name suggests, when
active will prevent a Flight Group from appearing in the mission if there isn't
a human pilot behind the controls. PlayerCraft works the same as TIE, with
00 being the default and 01 starting at position 2.

Yaw, Pitch and Roll values only work for Space Objects (mines, buoys, etc), and
like TIE the flight engine automaticlly adds a -90° (nose down) pitch angle.

Another obvious value, then the Arrival Triggers. In sentence form, Triggers
are "if Amount of VariableType Variable are Condition, then true". The Arrival
and Departure triggers are just that. The Alternate triggers are there for if
the originals can't be satisfied (mothership isn't in play). *Or* booleans are
evaluated as And=false, Or=true. For the case of Triggers, determines if one or
both Triggers must be completed to evaluate to true. The 12Or34 value likewise
detmines if both trigger pairs must evaluate to true or not. The ARR_DELAY
works as expected, with the countdown starting after the Trigger has been
fired. The DEP_DELAY changed from TIE, in that it now too starts the countdown
from the firing of the Trigger. The AbortTrigger value applies only to
individual craft, not the entire flight group. The Arrive/DepartViaMothership
values when false will cause craft to use hyperspace.

Orders, they're what make the world go 'round. Pick the Order from the list
and go from there. Throttle is expressed as (10 - %Throttle / 10). So 100%
Throttle would be 00, 90% would be 01, 80% would be 02, etc. The Variables are
controlled by the order itself, as different orders take different amounts for
different reasons. Target# and Target#Type are the same as a Trigger's Variable
and VariableType. The Speed value can override the simple Throttle method
and set Flight Group's speed in MGLT. Helpful for convoys of differing craft.
The value stored is not actually the MGLT value, but a fairly close
approximation of MGLT / 2.2235 (I say fairly close because that's what I
tweaked the multipler to get no difference up to index 100). The Designation
string is a note that will show in the CMD as the craft's orders when you
target it.

XvT also gives us the first attempt at a dynamic mission with the
SkipToOrder4 triggers. As you can guess, if this trigger fires the FG will
immediately jump to their Order[3]. There is a number of uses for this, but
that's best saved for a mission creation guide.

Goals are for that specific flight group. In XvT you have 8 for a given FG,
and all can be given point values, stored as (Points / 250), yielding a range
of [-32000, +31750]. A new value in XvT is the Argument, which is defined as
00	must
01	must NOT
02	BONUS must
03	BONUS must NOT

The Team values lets you assign to which team the goals apply, and the Enabled
is just another boolean on/off switch.  One of the Unkonwns in the goal may be
time related, as XvTEd has a "Time?" box, but this isn't something I've played
with yet. For the love of God use these goals instead of Global Goals if
possible.

Waypoints are pretty simple, the array is X, Y, Z and Enabled in that order.
The values are expressed as (Coordinate * 160), such that a value of 50 is
0.50km, A0 is 1.00km, etc. The Enable value just tells the application if it
needs to pay attention to it or not and is boolean, although it does occupy a
SHORT. If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the application will pick one to
use. Note that there are 8 different briefing WPs you can use, one for each.

Now here is where the bulk of the new material has been placed. Starting off
with the Countermeasures, this is a very short list of
00	None
01	Chaff
02	Flare

CraftExplosionTime acts strangely, and I haven't pinned it down exactly yet.
It does affect how long it takes for a dying craft to dissappear, but seems to
act differently with different ship classes and there is an unknown multipler
from the stored value to seconds.

Another Status value for you to use, followed by GlobalUnit. Similar to GG,
GU can take multiple Flight Groups and assign them a single number for easy
triggers and targets. Another use is to share craft numbering.

The Optional values are the alternate loadouts that the player can select when
going over his craft. As you can see you can list the majority of items and
several craft at any given time. The Category value allows you to easily
select a given ship list.
00	None
01	All Flyable
02	All Rebel Flyable
03	All Imperial Flyable
04	User Defined

-- Section 2a - Backdrops --
Backdrops (stars, planets, etc) are special types of flight groups. Value
definitions change for these purposes, which will be laid out here.

The primary value here is Status1, which becomes the Backdrop value. This
determines the graphic used. The majority of other values are ignored.

-- Message --

A simple section, there is the message string, the SendTo* array, the triggers,
a delay, and the *Or* value.  The EditorNote serves no purpose within the game
itself, and is merely there for bookkeeping use in the editor. The only special
item of note is that the Delay value is evaluated to (seconds / 5), such that
01 is 5s, 03 is 15s, etc.

The message string actually holds a second purpose, that is defining the color
of the message itself. The default message color is red, if the message starts
with '1' it is green, '2' is blue and '3' is yellow. The number will not appear
when displayed in-game.

-- GlobalGoal --

When FG goals just won't cut it, that's what there are for. Nothing really new
here, Points is the same as GoalFG.Points. The array is Primary, Prevent and
Secondary in that order. This Section is repeated 10 times, once for each team.

-- Team --

This section also repeats 10 times, once for each team. In here we have
obviously the Name, its alliances (boolean values), and the mission goal
messages. There's enough blank space at the end of the section for another
string, but as far as I know it's never used.  The goal messages also follow
the same color behaviour as in-flight messages.

EndOfMissionMessages are 64 character strings, not terminated. It's really a
[64][3,2] array, as the strings are PrimaryComplete1, PrimaryComplete2,
PrimaryFailed1, PrimaryFailed2, SecondaryComplete1, SecondaryComplete2.

-- Briefing --

Okay, we finally get to the briefing. The command listing itself I'll leave
for the list definition, that'll also have the variable listing as well. The
first value is the duration of the briefing itself in ticks. XvT uses 0x14
ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-4 additional variables. These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command. The last four active bytes in the Event
array is always 0F 27 22 00, which is the EndBriefing command at time 9999, and
usually isn't the last four bytes in the section (that would be a rather busy
briefing).

The StartsLength value is the number of SHORTs, Variables included, that occur
at Time=0. EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events
array up to and including the EndBriefing command.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes. They have a minimum length of
64 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero. If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is omitted. That's the real highlight right there.

-- FGGoalStrings --

Simple, fast, and the majority of the time empty. Instead of using the default
strings on the goal listing you can define your own here. This section is a
fixed size, and occurs once for each Flight Group.

The array structure is 3 strings per goal, 8 goals per FG. Incomplete, Complete
and Failed in that order.

-- GlobalGoalStrings --

For the most part, the same as FGGoalStrings. Define your own strings, this
section is always here with a fixed size and repeats 10 times, once for each
team. 

The array structure here is 3 strings per Trigger, 4 Triggers per goal, 3 goals
per Team. Strings are Incomplete, Complete and Failed in that order. Goals are
Primary, Prevent and Secondary in that order.

Prevent Failed is always empty. Secondary Incomplete and Failed are always
empty.

-- MissionDescription --

As noted in the structure listing, this section differs depending on platform.
It's a really long string(s), it's so hard. For BoP, the array is
SuccessfulDebrief, FailedDebrief, MissionDescription in that order.

There you have it, the XvT Mission file format. Enjoy :P
