Introduction
------------
The first of many battles featuring the ISD-II Challenge after its recommissioning in July 2020.

In this first battle, the ISD-II Challenge is responding to a distress signal from a convoy 
carrying Imperial supplies. As the brave Challenge pilots hyper into the unknown, 
the Commodore can only wonder where this will end.
