Introduction
------------
In 2016, the ISD-II Hammer lost the big Raise the Flag competition. 
...For the third year in a row.
...Out of the 3 years the competition has been held.
Needless to say, it's Wing Commander, Major Task, and the Commodore, High Admiral Anahorn Dempsey, were not pleased.
However, Major Task decided to steal a shuttle and go AWOL, which is completely unacceptable.

And so, you will hunt him down, even though the Commodore has punished you most harshly for your performance during
Raise the Flag 2016!
